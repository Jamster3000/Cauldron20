        "Description": "Baldur’s Gate was founded by sailors, and its harbor is still the city’s beating heart. Several patriars are descended from captains of yore, the commerce of the Lower City is built on the port, and even the Outer City’s rhythms are dominated by the ebb and flow of river trade. Because sailors are as fundamental and ubiquitous to Baldur’s Gate as the cobbles on its streets, characters with this background are common.\n\nYou sailed on a seagoing vessel for years. In that time, you faced down mighty storms, monsters of the deep, and those who wanted to sink your craft to the bottomless depths. Your first love is the distant line of the horizon, but the time has come to try your hand at something new.\n\nDiscuss the nature of the ship you previously sailed with your Dungeon Master. Was it a merchant ship, a naval vessel, a ship of discovery, or a pirate ship? How famous (or infamous) is it? Is it widely traveled? Is it still sailing, or is it missing and presumed lost with all hands?\n\nWhat were your duties on board—boatswain, captain, navigator, cook, or some other position? Who were the captain and first mate? Did you leave your ship on good terms with your fellows, or on the run?\n\nSkill Proficiencies: Athletics, Perception\n\nTool Proficiencies: Navigator’s tools, vehicles (water)\n\nEquipment: A belaying pin (club), 50 feet of silk rope, a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random trinket on the Trinkets table in chapter 5 of the Player’s Handbook), a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp\n\nFeature: Ship’s Passage\n\nWhen you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you’re calling in a favor, you can’t be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.\n\nBaldur’s Gate Feature: Smuggler’s Sense\n\nYou’re familiar with the docks of Baldur’s Gate, the movement of inspectors and tax collectors, the way cargo and coin flows. As a result, it’s easy for you to hustle a load of cargo ashore or see such a cargo onto a cooperative ship without attracting suspicion or taxation. You also know the movements of the Gray Wavers—the Flaming Fist harbor guards—and have a sense of how to operate the city’s mechanized cranes.\n\nVariant Sailor: Pirate\n\nYou spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a world of sharks and savages. You’ve indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you’ve garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.\n\nVariant Feature: Bad Reputation\n\nIf your character has a sailor background, you may select this background feature instead of Ship’s Passage.\n\nNo matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.",
