# What is this? ðŸ”®

Cauldron20, a chrome extension that provides functionalily between character sheets on [dndbeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) and [Cauldron](https://www.cauldron-vtt.net). It reads data from a character sheet on dndbeyond and can use different data from it into different areas of cauldron VTT.

If you already use Cauldron-vtt, you might be interested in the offical cauldron-vtt discord server: [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Bbg4TACH).

# How it works
This works by clicking on the extension and entering your character sheet's number (e.g. 112012248). This will then use dndbeyond's api for character sheets. It will remember your character so this will be a one time input. If you want to use a different character just input a new number and your old character will be replaced with the new one (there are plans for mulitple characters).

# Installation ðŸš€
To install and try this extension
1) download all the code on this github
2) extract the code from the zip folder
3) Open Chome and navigate to extensions [chome extensions](chrome://extensions/)
4) Make sure that developer mode is enabled on top right.
5) Top left, choose "load unpacked" and choose the folder that contains the code.
6) Clicking on the extention and input the number that identifies your character (make sure that your character sheet on dndbeyond is in public so it can be accessed by the extension).

Alternatively if you are using **Firefox** as your web browser you can search up cauldron20 as it's an add-on on Firefox's store.

See [wiki](https://github.com/Jamster3000/cauldron20/wiki) for more in depth instructions on how to setup the extension and use it.
